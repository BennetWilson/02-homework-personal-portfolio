=== Personal Portfolio Homework 02 ===

=== Description ===
I made a personal portfolio that displays a nav bar with buttons, a large section with my name, a section about me, a portfolio section and a contact me section

I used several sources while doing this project as I needed help with css positioning. I used MDN docs: [a link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) 
I found i could not grasp the concept well enough through reading so i found a youtube video  that I used as a reference for how to position certain elements and how to design a contact me section without having to put personal information on the web.
