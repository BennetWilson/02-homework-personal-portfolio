# Personal Portfolio Homework 02

# Updated:

I have added updated portfolio images as well as links to my projects accessible by clicking each image.

I have updated the README.md links and how I linked the images.

I added bootstrap links and will  be updating this project over the holiday break.

For the time being, my instructor has advised us to put very little effort into this homework as we have a group project that is a higher priority.


## Description
I made a personal portfolio that displays a nav bar with buttons, a large section with my name, a section about me, a portfolio section and a contact me section.
I made this website using HTML and CSS
