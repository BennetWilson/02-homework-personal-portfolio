          <h2>BENNET WILSON</h2>
          <p>
            I was born and raised (mostly) in Mesa, Arizona. I spent two years
            of my life when I was in the fourth and fifth grade in England. My
            family moved two hours south of London so that my father could
            expand a Boeing program into the UK.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After moving back, I lived in my childhood home and went to the same
            highschool that my siblings attended. After graduating I was
            accepted into NAU, where I graduated with a Bachelor's in Business
            Management and a Minor in Marketing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Not long after graduting, I had my first real job as an IT
            recruiter. I couldn't have been more unhappy and started to explore
            different avenues of work until I realised I was looking for a job
            with some technicality to it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I tried several different things, but none really peaked my interest
            until I found Codecademy and started to learn a little bit of
            programming. I was hooked. So, now I am pursuing my new-found
            passion for programming and hope to be a web developer in a few
            short months.
